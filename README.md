# Study Abroad Prep App Prototype 
### Front End

Technologies used: React, hosted on Surge

This is the static front end version of a full stack app I am currently producing. It was built as a final project, and due to bugs, confusion and time restraints, I decided to build this static prototype site in a day. 

In the true app, API calls will call the necessary data from the db, and the server will allow for users to upload comments and add their own photos of their favorite places around Barcelona. A gold feature would be to add the ability for users to add their own marks on the map and create their own "favorite site" page for others to see. 

Here is the back-end currently in development: https://github.com/HannahAurand/barcelona_backend
Here is the front-end that was formerly in development: https://github.com/HannahAurand/barcelona_frontend

This was an attempt to understand React props and utilize them correctly, but one cannot just learn react in a short amount of time as a newb. So the beat goes on, da da da dum da dum dum...(Eminem, "Spaghetti") (meaning I'm continuing my project to learn the best practice).


## Projected User Stories: 
1. User can add comments
2. User can click on points on map and see data about that point, with comments on that page
3. User can add their own photos to said point's gallery
